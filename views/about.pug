        This website was created as part of a job recruitment process.
        It is the second iteration: there is also a
        <a href="//github.com/zuzak/joblist">previous iteration</a>,
        as a similar near-simultaneous job application had the same brief.
      p.
        Between these two projects, a GOV.UK ripoff was created to practice
        using the GOV.UK toolkit, which is where much of the difference between
        the two projects lies. It is available as
        <a href="//github.com/zuzak/gov.zk">gov.zk</a>.
